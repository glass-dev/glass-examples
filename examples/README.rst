These examples show how `GLASS`__, the Generator for Large Scale Structure, can
be used in practice.  They are often a good starting point for more complicated
and realistic simulations.

To run the examples yourself, you need to have GLASS installed.  To install the
specific version of GLASS for the examples you are reading:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ pip install |pip_package|

The examples currently require `CAMB`__ to produce angular matter power spectra
and for the cosmological background.  Make sure you have CAMB installed::

    $ python -c 'import camb'  # should not give an error

If you want to compute the angular matter power spectra in the examples, you
need the `glass.ext.camb` package::

    $ pip install glass.ext.camb
